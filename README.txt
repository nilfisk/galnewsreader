Description:

 Small GO Program allowing to read the headlines from Frontier's Elite:Dangerous GalNews
 page or single article summaries. The idea is to have Windows TextToSpeech Engine read
 the news aloud while flying.
 A small powershell script to "say" a string is included

License:
 why GPL3? why *NOT*????

Useage:
 galnewsreader [-item=n]
 if -item is specified, only the corresponding summary 'n' will be printed out. If it is not
 specified or n equals 0 only the headlines will be printed out.
 Plans to be able to get a complete article are there, but right now I just want to play E:D
